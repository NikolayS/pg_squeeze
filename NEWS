Release 1.0.2
=============

Bug fixes
---------

* Close pg_class relation and its scan if exiting early (i.e. catalog change
  was detected).

* Defend against race conditions that allow for applying of the concurrent
  changes which have already been captured by the initial load.

* Do not use "initial load memory context" to fetch tuples from table or
  index.

  If the load takes place in multiple "batches" (i.e. tuplesort is not used),
  that memory context gets freed before the next batch starts and the call fo
  squeeze_table() function results in SEGFAULT.


Release 1.0.1
=============

Bug fixes
---------

* Try harder to avoid out-of-memory conditions.
